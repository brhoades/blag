      <p>One on ones are one of the most important tools that a manager
      has. You either have effective, regular, clear 1-on-1s or you pay
      in employee retention, satisfaction, and development.</p>
      <h1 id="why-i-am-writing-this">Why I am Writing This</h1>
      <p>As an engineer, 1-on-1s were important to me. They gave an
      opportunity to bring topics to my manager that otherwise didn’t
      have an outlet, receive and provide feedback, and track successes
      and failures throughout the year. Unfortunately, 1-on-1s aren’t
      mandatory at Cerner; yet for me, they were the reason that I hit 2
      years and became a team lead.</p>
      <p>Today, I manage a team that handles high priority client
      requests while simultaneously on-boarding new engineers (365
      days/yr support). I could not have survived the last year and
      on-boarded 5 engineers without regular, effective 1-on-1s. Now
      that I’m on the opposite side of 1-on-1s, I can see the traps
      managers fall into that lead 1-on-1s to doom: * Rescheduling,
      pushing back, and cancelling as something “critical” came up. *
      Ending early / starting late frequently. * Neither participant
      drives or the meeting is too unstructured. * Conversation and
      information is one way. * Surface-level topics and recent events
      are discussed.</p>
      <h2 id="one-on-ones-are-bidirectional">One-on-Ones Are
      Bidirectional</h2>
      <p>Misleading my reports into believing that 1-on-1s are their
      meetings communicates what I want out of the meeting. Overall, the
      meetings are mine and mandatory; but it is for my report’s growth
      to our team’s benefit. My intention in “giving” them the meeting
      is to set the stage that this meeting doesn’t exist without them
      and that they set the agenda.</p>
      <h3 id="one-on-ones-need-structure-and-regularity">One-on-Ones
      Need Structure and Regularity</h3>
      <p>I meet twice a month for one hour each with each of my reports
      in a private, quiet room with our laptops. We have a meeting
      document for minutes, with a template that my report fills out in
      advance:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <h1 id="date-mmddyyyy">Date: MM/DD/YYYY</h1>
      <p><em>What’s going on? What have you completed?</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>What have you learned?</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>What’s going well? Anything to brag about?</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>What’s blocking / challenging you? Anything we can
      improve?</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Feedback from &lt;manager&gt;:</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Feedback from &lt;report&gt;:</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li>Flip:
      <ul>
      <li>First meeting of the month: revisit goals, achievements, and
      areas of opportunity.</li>
      <li>Second meeting of the month: manager reflection.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Other topics / action items:</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Review feedback and TODOs from last meeting.</li>
      <li></li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This template provides a clear agenda and reduces the amount of
      time spent digging. If the agenda isn’t filled out in advance, you
      must pressure them to recollect for each section. Honestly, it
      usually isn’t filled out ahead of time and they fill it out as I
      walk to the meeting room. This template also varies for each
      report; the question “What have you learned?” provides little
      value to more senior engineers versus a college apprentice.</p>
      <p>The top half of this template serves as minutes for our
      1-on-1s. The contents of these sections are conversation starters:
      focus on the hows and whys over the whats. 1-on-1s are
      <strong>not</strong> long-form scrums. I dig into these bullets
      with questions like: * How was that? Did you enjoy it? * Would you
      want to do it again, knowing what you know now? How would you
      change your execution? * Did you do that without assistance? *
      What can we do to make other tasks [not] like that? * Is there
      anything I can do to help next time? * Everything else went
      awesome/terrible? * Digging: you didn’t work on anything else this
      sprint, just &lt;single item&gt;? You didn’t learn anything
      else?</p>
      <h3 id="feedback-and-expectations">Feedback and Expectations</h3>
      <p>The most important two sections of the 1-on-1 template cover
      feedback. I can’t talk about feedback without giving the three
      steadfast rules of feedback: * You aren’t giving enough of it. *
      It’s not feedback unless it’s constructive, agreed upon, and makes
      things better. * You still aren’t giving enough of it.</p>
      <h4 id="positive-feedback-morale-and-timing">Positive Feedback,
      Morale, and Timing</h4>
      <p><img src="/assets/images/oneonones-feedback.png"
      alt="feedback comic" /> <em>Julie Zhuo, <strong>The Making of a
      Manager</strong></em></p>
      <p>This comic summarizes an important point Julie Zhuo makes about
      feedback in <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567"><em>The
      Making of a Manager</em></a>. People want to succeed, but it’s
      hard to without knowing where they stand. Positive feedback should
      come easy to a manager and you should have a lot of it. It can go
      from “I couldn’t run this team without you” to “I can tell you are
      struggling but really trying hard: keep at it.” Positive feedback
      doesn’t need to mention specific events or even be given at
      1-on-1s.</p>
      <p><strong>You must give positive feedback</strong>. The amount
      will vary and it’s an art; some people know where they’re at while
      others need regular pep talks. Whatever it takes, your reports
      should leave 1-on-1s with an impression of where they sit in your
      eyes. If they only learn where they sit with you when raises come
      out, <strong>you have failed them as a manager</strong>. Whether
      you’re meeting expectations should never be a surprise for anyone.
      By waiting until the of the cycle, you have stolen your report’s
      agency to improve or raise the bar. Your report likely spent the
      year feeling uneasy about where they stand in your eyes.</p>
      <h4 id="negative-feedback">Negative Feedback</h4>
      <p>Negative feedback is harder than positive feedback for a
      variety of reasons: * Atmosphere and relationship with your report
      must allow for a <em>conversation</em> about their faults and
      mistakes. * Situational feedback must be given shortly after an
      event or else it reads passive aggressive. * Hopefully a nonzero
      amount of your reports exceed you in some domain and utilize those
      skills, leaving you groping for feedback in the dark. *
      Confrontation is simultaneously uncomfortable and critical. *
      Presenting feedback well is like making food that tastes
      <em>and</em> looks good.</p>
      <h5 id="atmosphere-and-relationship">Atmosphere and
      Relationship</h5>
      <p>Poor meeting atmosphere or report relationship is the hardest
      issue to overcome. For me, I always open any major feedback with a
      variant of the following: &gt; I am about to give you constructive
      feedback. I’ve spent a lot of time on this because I care about
      your development and want you to be awesome. &gt; I’ll give you
      details about this feedback and why you are getting it, then
      you’ll have a chance to discuss it and agree or disagree with
      me.</p>
      <p>Depending on how your relationship is, you may leave out
      agreement. For all relationships, keep in mind that if your report
      doesn’t agree with your feedback, they likely won’t incorporate
      it.</p>
      <p>I’ve also found that prepping your reports for hard feedback
      becomes easier if you set expectations in a prior meeting (even
      the last meeting). Tell them exactly what you expect out of them
      with some solid metrics. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I expect that you: * Will be self-sufficient with coding. If
      you ask someone senior to you a coding question and they answer it
      in less than a minute, you are not meeting expectations. * Will
      finish 3 points of work a sprint. We can discuss specifics around
      larger stories / shorter sprints when they come up. If you are
      assigned something that isn’t a 3 pointer but is marked as one,
      you should yell loudly. * Will sign off (or comment why you will
      not) on every code review that is assigned to you.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This gives them a cold splash of water without outright telling
      them that they are not meeting some invisible expectations. At the
      next meeting, they are either doing great and you revisit the
      expectations for praise or you give them the feedback you had
      planned. Either way, <em>no surprises</em>. Setting expectations
      is critical to delivering effective and usable feedback.</p>
      <h5 id="situational-feedback">Situational Feedback</h5>
      <p>The solution to other non-relationship feedback difficulties is
      simpler: give more of it, more often, and ask them if you are
      correct. Aim for quantity, people are really good at sifting
      through noisy data and engineers are especially good at arguing. I
      can easily say that most of my feedback is less wide-reaching than
      outright failing to meet expectations. Zhuo has a clever way of
      splitting feedback up into three categories, two I’ll steal:
      situational feedback and behavioral feedback.</p>
      <p>Situational feedback is task-specific or accident-based. A
      report made a notable a mistake on a code review? I didn’t expect
      you to do this, let’s talk about it and how we can improve. This
      is fairly easy to do but it must be delivered early. A good rule
      of thumb for how early is to literally follow your gut. Feedback
      urgency is directly proportional to how uncomfortable it makes you
      to deliver.</p>
      <h5 id="behavioral-second-order-feedback">Behavioral, Second-Order
      Feedback</h5>
      <p>Behavioral feedback is more difficult; it’s second-order
      feedback which requires taking a step back and looking at trends.
      Like some poetry, behavioral feedback should have <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)">a rhyme to
      it</a>. You should look for patterns in past feedback which could
      be brought to their attention. Some real examples:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Report routinely spends more time correcting their spelling
      and grammatical mistakes than fixing technical issues in technical
      documents.</li>
      <li>Report is having issues getting work completed in the last few
      sprints. You’ve observed multiple times that they tend to work
      really fast the night before the end of the sprint.</li>
      <li>Report always seems nervous, avoids eye contact, and shuffles
      to and from their desk with eyes down. You probably haven’t called
      this out before.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s easy when it’s written out like this, but these issues are
      summaries of problems that spanned multiple months. Once you put
      the patterns together, you call out set of actions to address
      this:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li><em>Communication skills</em>. Specifically: review your
      documents multiple times prior to sending them out. Run them
      through TTS, note the mistakes you make in a notebook, and check
      the list of mistakes prior to sending the next document out .</li>
      <li><em>Time management</em>. Set clear mid sprint deadlines for
      stories and decrease the complexity of their stories until they
      reach it. Force them to front-load their work effort by making
      them work late.</li>
      <li><em>Soft/interpersonal</em> skills. Tell them what they’re
      doing and how it’ll affect them in the long run. Make sure they
      understand your intentions and that you don’t expect a 2 week
      turnaround.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Also like poetry, if feedback rhymes too much it gets bad. If
      your situational and behavioral feedback has a strong rhyme, it’s
      time to move from being a peacetime manager to a wartime
      manager.</p>
      <h4 id="gathering-feedback">Gathering Feedback</h4>
      <p>Feedback should come easily if you are involved with your
      report’s day-to-day activities. Otherwise, it’s hard and you must
      rely on others. Regardless, you should be reaching out to your
      peers and your report’s peers with regularity. Gather multiple
      sources and keep them anonymous to your report; you do not want
      them to feel like they need to be careful around specific
      individuals.</p>
      <p>Do not ask “Do you have any feedback for &lt;report&gt;?” If
      you get something out of that, it’s going to be festering, stale
      feedback. You must ask pointed questions, piecemeal, in a
      conversation to avoid overwhelming them. Some example questions: *
      What could they do today to be better? * How often do you speak
      with them? Is that too much or too little? * Do you like working
      with them? Why or why not? * What do they do that grates on you?
      How about impresses you? * Where would you rank them relative to
      &lt;known exceptional employee&gt;? How about &lt;rising star
      employee&gt;? * What can I do to make them a better coworker? *
      Have they done anything this week that really floored / bothered
      you? * Have they done anything this week that really impressed
      you?</p>
      <h3 id="manager-feedback">Manager Feedback</h3>
      <p>1-on-1s should be bidirectional. You spend the first part of
      1-on-1s digging for the known unknowns and discussing them. The
      free time at the tail end of the meeting should be dedicated to
      finding the unknown unknowns. On odd meetings, we reflect on
      <em>my</em> performance as a manager. After all, my reports’ fates
      are intertwined with the quality of my management; if I’m doing an
      awful job they’ll likely fail with me.</p>
      <p>Here are questions I ask every other 1-on-1: * What could I do
      to make your job awesome? * How am I doing and how could I be
      doing better? * If you had your pick at the company, who would you
      want to be your manager and why? * What should <em>we</em> be
      doing that we are not? * If I gave you carte blanche this sprint,
      what would you do for two weeks? * Are there any questions that
      I’m not asking you that I should be?</p>
      <p>These questions mean nothing if your report feels like they
      will be penalized for their answers. Make sure they are aware this
      isn’t a manager/report discussion, but rather a you/them
      discussion. If the thought of asking any of these questions makes
      you uncomfortable or afraid, you need to ask them.
      <strong>Now.</strong> That discomfort is a signal that you know
      something will be brought up.</p>
      <p>At worst, these questions allow reports to feel heard. At best,
      these questions are a source of discussion, feedback from people
      who experience your job performance, and make you aware of what’s
      going well or poorly in your organization.</p>
      <h3 id="accountability---other-topics">Accountability - Other
      Topics</h3>
      <p>Other topics always carry an item to discuss previous TODOs and
      feedback from previous meetings. This is a reminder for you and
      your report that you will revisit feedback and expectations each
      meeting. Leaf through the last month of 1-on-1s and bring up any
      feedback, discussions, and action items that are still
      relevant.</p>

      Place to Work</a></p>
      <p>Being too busy to have 1-on-1s is the same as being too thirsty
      to drink. You will be busy when an employee quits due to a
      circumstance that could have been identified and rectified. When
      you have to onboard a new hire, you’ll sacrifice team capacity to
      get them up to speed. When a senior engineer leaves, you’ll get
      their work and distribute it to teammates.</p>
      <p>You can’t cancel 1-on-1s when something critical comes up.
      Something is always wrong, something is always on fire, something
      will always be critical. Nothing is more important than your
      people. Unlike individual events, people are a constant. You can
      prevent fires by training, growing, and building relationships
      your people. You can delegate critical things to people that you
      trust and have established relationships with.</p>
      <p>1-on-1s are an end to a potential death spiral of being busy,
      fighting fires, having unhappy employees, and losing important
      people.</p>
