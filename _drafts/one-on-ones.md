# Non-Optional Feedback
Effective one on ones are one of the most important tools a manager has to facilitate employee retention, satisfaction, and development. You either have regular, clear, and effective 1-on-1s or you pay for their absence in the categories above.

# Why I am Writing This

About a year ago, I was given the opportunity to be a manager at Cerner. Before becoming a manager, 1-on-1s were important to me as an engineer. 1-on-1s gave an opportunity to bring topics to my manager that otherwise didn't have an outlet, receive and provide feedback, and track successes and failures throughout the year. I seemed to have lucked out here; I don't think that most managers at Cerner do 1-on-1s. Yet for me, they were the reason I've stayed for 2 years and became a team lead at 2 years.

Now, I'm currently the manager of backlog, a poorly named team that handles high priority client requests while simultaneously on-boarding new engineers (365 days/yr support). I could not have survived the last year and on-boarded 5 new hires without regular, effective 1-on-1s with my reports. Additionally, I see peers that do not value 1-on-1s like I do. I suspect this is due to poor utilization and structure of that time; this is something I can help with.

I am not blind to the traps that managers fall into with 1-on-1s easily:
 * Rescheduling and pushing back as something "critical" came up.
 * Ending early or starting late frequently.
 * Neither participant drives the meeting / it's too unstructured.
 * Conversation and information flows one way.
 * Only surface-level topics and recent events are discussed.

Any of these can lead to 1-on-1s falling off your calendar with neither report nor manager setting them up again. However, these are all preventable with good structure, bidirectional feedback, a good atmosphere, and less than a dozen hours a month of your time.

## One-on-Ones Are Bidirectional
I've found that lying to my reports about 1-on-1s being their meeting is a great way to drive home what the meeting is for. In general, I really do mean that this is their meeting: they can set the agenda and drive it. Unfortunately, I tend to drive the meeting anyway, provide a recurring calendar event with a room, provision a private 1-on-1 document that acts as minutes, and prepare a great deal for the meeting. We meet twice a month for one hour each, in a private, quiet room with our laptops. In our meeting document we utilize a template for minutes:

> # Date: MM/DD/YYYY
>
> *What's going on? What have you completed?*
>
>   * 
>
> *What have you learned?*
>
>   * 
>
> *What's going well? Anything to brag about?*
>
>   * 
>
> *What's blocking / challenging you? Anything we can improve?*
>
>   * 
>
> *Feedback from \<manager\>:*
>
>   * 
>
> *Feedback from \<report\>:*
>
>   * 
>   * Flip:
>     * First meeting of the month: revisit goals, achievements, and areas of opportunity.
>     * Second meeting of the month: manager reflection.
>
> *Other topics / action items:*
>
>   * Review feedback and TODOs from last meeting.
>   * 

I tell reports to copy and fill this ahead of each meeting in our document. This template provides a clear agenda and reduces the amount of time spent digging like a congressional hearing. If the agenda isn't filled out in advance, you must pressure them to recollect for each section. Being honest, it usually isn't filled out ahead of time and they fill it out as I walk to the meeting room. This template also varies for each report; the question "What have you learned?" provides little value to more senior engineers versus a college apprentice.

### Semi-weekly minutes
The top half of this template serves as minutes for our 1-on-1s. During the meeting, its primary purpose is as a conversation starter. At the end of the year, it becomes a historical record of accomplishments and challenges for the review cycle. Throughout the meeting, I dig and discuss discuss each point of each section. Some example questions for the first four sections include:
 * How was that?
 * Would you want to do it again, knowing what you know now? How would you change?
 * Did you do that without assistance?
 * What can we do to make other tasks [not] like that?
 * Is there anything I can do to help next time?
 * Everything else went awesome/terrible?
 * You didn't work on anything else this sprint, just \<single item\>? You didn't learn anything else?

### Feedback and Expectations
There are three steadfast rules about feedback:
 * You aren't giving enough of it.
 * It's not feedback unless it's constructive, agreed upon, and makes things better.
 * You still aren't giving enough of it.

#### Positive Feedback and Performance Cycles

*Julie Zhuo, **The Making of a Manager***

More or less, this is the song Julie Zhuo sings about feedback in [_The Making of a Manager_](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567). People want to succeed, but it's very hard to without being told how they are doing. In reality, positive feedback should be easy and you should have a lot of it. It could be as simple as "you finished up early this sprint, nice job" or "you really wow'd me with how you took that problem and ran with it". If you need to aim low, as someone is struggling, it can be simply acknowledging that "I can tell you are really trying hard: keep at it."

**You must give positive feedback**. The amount will vary and it's an art; some people know where they're at while others need a few pep talks from time-to-time. Whatever it takes, your reports should leave 1-on-1s with an impression of where they sit in your eyes. If they only learn where they sit with you when raises come 'round, **you have failed them as a manager**. Whether you're meeting expectations should never be a surprise for anyone. By waiting until the of the cycle, you have stolen report's agency to do anything about what you just told them. This is a grave disservice; you stole a year of opportunity from them to discuss how they could be even better. Additionally, your report likely spent the year feeling uneasy about where they stand in your eyes.

#### Negative Feedback
Negative/constructive feedback is harder for several reasons:
 * Atmosphere and relationship with your report must allow for a _conversation_ about their faults and mistakes.
 * Situational feedback must be given shortly after an event or else it reads passive aggressive.
 * Hopefully a nonzero amount of your reports exceed you in some domain and utilize those skills, leaving you groping for feedback in the dark.
 * Confrontation simultaneously uncomfortable and critical.
 * Presenting feedback well is like making food that tastes _and_ looks good.


##### Atmosphere and Relationship
Poor meeting atmosphere or report relationship is the hardest issue to overcome. For me, I always open any major feedback with a variant of the following:
> I am about to give you constructive feedback. I've spent a lot of time on this because I care about your development and want you to be awesome.
> I'll give you details about this feedback and why you are getting it, then you'll have a chance to discuss it and agree or disagree with me.

Depending on how bad your relationship is, you may want to leave out the agreement part. I've also found that prepping your reports for hard feedback becomes easier if you set expectations in a prior meeting (even the last meeting). Tell them exactly what you expect out of them with some solid metrics. For example:

> I expect that you:
>   * Will be self-sufficient with coding. If you ask someone senior to you a coding question and they answer it in less than a minute, you are not meeting expectations.
>   * Will finish 3 points of work a sprint. We can discuss specifics around larger stories / shorter sprints when they come up. If you are assigned something that isn't a 3 pointer but is marked as one, you should yell loudly.
>   * Will sign off (or comment why you will not) on every code review that is assigned to you.

This gives them a cold splash of water without outright telling them that they are not meeting some invisible expectations. At the next meeting, they are either doing great and you revisit the expectations for praise or you give them the feedback you had planned. Either way, _no surprises_. Setting expectations is critical to delivering effective and usable feedback.

##### Situational Feedback

The solution to other non-relationship feedback difficulties is simpler: give more of it, more often, and ask them if you are correct. Aim for quantity; people are really good at sifting through noisy data and engineers are especially good at arguing. To assist in this, I can easily say that most of my feedback is less wide-reaching than outright failing to meet expectations. Zhuo has a clever way of splitting feedback up into three categories, two I'll steal: situational feedback and behavioral feedback.

Situational feedback is task-specific or accident-based. Report made a notable a mistake on a code review? I didn't expect you to do this, let's talk about it and how we can improve. This is fairly easy to do but it must be delivered early. A good rule of thumb for how early is to literally follow your gut. **Feedback urgency is directly proportional to how uncomfortable it makes you to deliver**. Some real examples:

> Report making the same, major mistake for the third time. You are disappointed and nauseous and you'll need to rethink your approach.

Meet this week; maybe bump your 1-on-1 up on your calendar.

> Report made a mistake you're going to laugh about with them.

Can wait until after vacation.

> Report misled you for two weeks with their progress. Now you're reading a book about management and tossing and turning at night thinking about it.

That's a 9 AM "<Manager> / <Report> Sync" with no description on it for added flare. You need to speak with them _yesterday_.

> Report blew your mind with finding a solution to a hard problem.

Send them a heartfelt attaboy this week.

##### Behavioral / Second-Order Feedback

Behavioral feedback is more difficult; it's second-order feedback which requires taking a step back and looking at trends. Like some poetry, behavioral feedback should have [a rhyme to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). You should look for patterns in past feedback which could be brought to their attention. Some real examples:

 1. Report routinely spends more time correcting their spelling and grammatical mistakes than fixing technical issues in technical documents.
 1. Report is having issues getting work completed in the last few sprints. You've observed multiple times that they tend to work really fast the night before the end of the sprint.
 1. Report is siloed into figuring out things on their own, but lacks the skills to answer their own questions / know when to give up. You rescue them and have pointed this out.
 1. Report always seems nervous, avoids eye contact, and shuffles to and from their desk with eyes down. You probably haven't called this out before.

Of course, it's easy when it's written out like this, but these issues are summaries of problems that spanned multiple months. Once you put the patterns together, you call out set of actions to address this:

 1. *Communication skills*. Specifically: review your documents multiple times prior to sending them out. Run them through a screen reader, note the mistakes you make in a notebook, and check the list of mistakes before you send the next document out. Advise them to read more literature to help improve. This likely extends to verbal communication.
 1. *Time management*. Set clear mid sprint deadlines for stories and decrease the complexity of their stories until they reach it. Force them to front-load their work effort by making them work late. Dig deeper for personal issues which may be distracting.
 1. *Time management*. Pomodoro timer or 15 minute egg timer for time spent investigating. Assign a strong mentor and give them the low-down.
 1. *Soft/interpersonal* skills. Tell them what they're doing and how it'll affect them in the long run. Make sure they understand your intentions and that you don't expect a 2 week turnaround.
 
Also like poetry, if feedback rhymes too much it stops being good. If your situational and behavioral feedback has a strong rhyme, it's time to move from being a peacetime manager to a wartime manager. This topic deserves its own blog post.

#### Gathering Feedback
Feedback should come easily if you are involved with your report's day-to-day activities. Otherwise, it's quite hard and you must rely on others. Either way, you should be reaching out to your peers and your report's peers with regularity. Gather multiple sources and keep them anonymous to your report; you do not want them to feel like they need to be careful around specific individuals.

Do not ask "Do you have any feedback for \<report\>?" If you get something out of that, it's probably feedback that's been festering. Anyone who responds well to that question was either anticipating it (and has been keeping notes) or has some passive-aggressive truthbomb on their belt. Either way, it's going to be stale. You must ask pointed questions, piecemeal, in a conversation to avoid overwhelming them. Some example questions:
 * What could they do today to be better?
 * How often do you speak with them? Is that too much or too little?
 * Do you like working with them? Why or why not?
 * What do they do that grates on you? How about impresses you?
 * Where would you rank them relative to \<known exceptional employee\>? How about \<rising star employee\>?
 * What can I do to make them a better coworker?
 * Have they done anything this week that really floored / bothered you?
 * Have they done anything this week that really impressed you?

### Manager Feedback
1-on-1s should be a two way street. You spend the first part of 1-on-1s digging for the known unknowns and discussing / recording them. The free time at the tail end of the meeting should be dedicated to finding the unknown unknowns. There's a lot more to be said on this than I care to detail on this blog, but recently I've added a recurring topic to my 1-on-1s. We flip between documenting goals, accomplishments, and areas of opportunities and reflecting on _my_ performance as a manager. After all, my reports' fates are intertwined with the quality of my management; if I'm doing an awful job they'll likely fail with me.

Here are a few questions that I ask every other 1-on-1:
 * What could I do to make your job awesome?
 * How am I doing and how could I be doing better?
 * If you had your pick at the company, who would you want to be your manager and why?
 * What should _we_ be doing that we are not?
 * If I gave you carte blanche this sprint, what would you do for two weeks?
 * Are there any questions that I'm not asking you that I should be?

These questions mean nothing if your report feels like they will be penalized for their answers. Make sure they are aware this isn't a manager/report discussion, but rather a you/them discussion. If the thought of asking any of these questions makes you uncomfortable or afraid, you need to ask them. **Now.** That discomfort is a signal that you know something will be brought up.

At worst, these questions allow reports to feel heard. At best, these questions are a source of discussion, feedback from people who experience your job performance, and make you aware of what's going well or poorly in your organization.

### Accountability - Other Topics
Other topics always carry an item to discuss previous TODOs and feedbacks from last meetings. This is a reminder for you and your report that you will revisit feedback and expectations each meeting. Leaf through the last month of 1-on-1s and bring up any feedback, discussions, and action items that are still relevant.
