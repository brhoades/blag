# Pitch. History about being a new manager. 1-on-1s as a report
Effective one on ones are _the_ most important tool a manager has employee retention, satisfaction, and development.


About a year ago, I was given the opportunity to be a manager at Cerner. Before even becoming a manager, 1-on-1s were important to me as an engineer. They gave me an opportunity to discuss topics with my manager that otherwise didn't have an outlet, receive and provide feedback, and track successes and failures throughout the year. I seemed to have lucked out here; I don't think that most managers at Cerner do 1-on-1s. Yet for me, 1-on-1s were likely the reason I've made it to the 3 year mark at Cerner and became a team lead. Having been the manager of a team that handles incoming defects and high priority work while simultaneously onboarding new engineers (365 days per year support), I could not have survived the last year without regular 1-on-1s with my reports.


That being said, I can see the traps that managers fall into with 1-on-1s easily:
 * Rescheduling and pushing back as something critical came up.
 * Ending early or starting late frequently.
 * Neither participant drives the meeting / it's too unstructured.
 * Conversation and information flows one way.

Any of these lead to 1-on-1s falling off your calendar and neither report nor manager setting them up again.

# Making 1-on-1s a two way street
I've found that telling my reports that 1-on-1s is their meeting is a great way to drive home what the meeting is for. This is mostly true, except there are some things I do for them: provide a recurring calendar event with a room, provisioning a private 1-on-1 document that acts as minutes, and preparing feedback for their improvement. We meet twice a month, for one hour each, though this amount varies depending on the report's hours. In our meeting minutes, there's a template where we ask some questions each time:

```
# Date: MM/DD/YYYY
*What's going on? What have you completed?*
  *
*What have you learned?*
  *
*What's going well? Anything to brag about?*
  * 
*What's blocking / challenging you? Anything we can improve?*
  * 
*Feedback from Billy*
  * 
*Feedback from <report>*
  *
*Other topics / action items*
  * Review feedback and TODOs from last meeting.
  *
```

I highly encourage reports to fill this ahead of each meeting as it provides a clear agenda and reduces the amount of time spent digging. If the agenda isn't filled out in advance, you get to pressure them to recollect and see what they can recall. Being honest, it usually isn't filled out ahead of time. This template also varies for each report; I don't care as much about what senior engineers are learning compared to new hires.

Throughout the meeting we discuss each point. Some example questions for the first four sections include:
 * How was that?
 * Would you want to do it again knowing what you know now?
 * Did you do that without assistance?
 * What can we do to make other tasks like that?
 * Is there anything I can do to help next time?
 * Everything else went awesome / was awful / you didn't learn anything else / nothing else was completed in two weeks?"
